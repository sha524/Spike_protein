# Research Project

# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in the UK


## Introduction to the project
Aims:

1.	Provide a complete overview of the general dataset trends
2.	Investigate the clustering and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in the UK
3.	Identify and characterise common spike mutations and non vs syn mutations
4.	Analyse their potential effects on viral infectivity, linking to the receptor binding domain/receptor binding motif
