# Research Project

# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in the UK


## Introduction to the project
### Aims:

- Provide a complete overview of the general dataset trends
- Investigate the clustering and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in the UK
- Identify and characterise common spike mutations and non vs syn mutations
- Analyse their potential effects on viral infectivity, linking to the receptor binding domain/receptor binding motif


### Purpose:
- Respository containing all the files used in the analysis
- This includes the R scripts, the figures generated, the data used and the respository

### Analysis:
Git was used alongside GitHub for version control and to maintain a remote respository

R was used for the majority of the analysis

git lfs was used for storage of large files

packages used:
- ggplot2
- Rmisc
- tidyverse
- viridis
- hrbrthemes
- pgirmess
- dplyr
- stringr
- devtools
- usethis
- cowplot
- mgcv




## The files

#### **data**
UK_seqs_msa_0522_spike_mutations.txt ➡️ Complete sequence data with unique identifier and mutation information

test_UK_seqs_msa_0522_spike_mutations.txt ➡️ First 100 sequences from the sequence data

#### **Plots and figures**

Practice ➡️ Any figures produced using the practice data

Real plots and figures ➡️ Figures for the report

#### **R scripts**

Practice scripts ➡️ Scripts for testing analysis before implementing on the actual data

Scripts for actual data ➡️ Scripts where the analysis for the report was performed

Data structure names ➡️ Names of the important data structures alongwith a description of what the structure contains

#### **Report**
